# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

This is a note taker application that required me to connect the front end files with the back end files. When the user activates the server running node server in the appropriate folder in the terminal, the user then can then visit http://localhost:3001/. From there, the user can click the get started button, then enter as many notes as desired, then save the notes.

The biggest challenge I had with this was trying to wrap my head around setting up the route and backend in order to connect it to the front end. While the site does work, I do hope to add ID function in order to select every saved note and add the option to delete notes. I'm also in the process of learning Heroku.
